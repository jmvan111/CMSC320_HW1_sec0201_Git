can be used to transfer work from pcs to laptops as well by makin guse of the Backup features and it also keeps track of version control 
and change history.It is very helpful in allowing multiple individuals to work on the same project, because of its branching and merging capabilities
which helps individuals work independtly and then merge their changes later on. It is also widely used in the coding industry, and is integrated
with many other tools.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines two branches together, while keeping the history of both branches. You would use this when you want to be able to see the entire development
history. Rebasing differs from merging in how it writes the history. Rebasing moves commits from one branch on top of the other branch, which makes it seem like there
was no merge commit. This provides you with a cleaner timeline, however you will not be able to see merge history.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to learning about Data Science and how to effectively use tools like SQL and Pandas. I also look forward to working with my group
members and creating a project that looks and functions well.
